# Crypto Readiness Lab (CRL)

## Purpose

Crypto Readiness Lab (CRL) is a digital education and preparedness platform designed to help people safely enter, understand, and navigate self-custodied digital assets.

CRL exists to reduce confusion, fear, and irreversible mistakes by providing clear, plain-language onboarding and risk awareness — without trading, custody, or financial advice.

This repository represents the **foundational structure and boundaries** of the CRL platform.

---

## What CRL Is

CRL is:

* An education-first onboarding platform
* A crypto readiness and risk-awareness system
* A self-paced, multilingual learning experience
* Designed for everyday people across ages, regions, and technical backgrounds

CRL focuses on understanding before action.

---

## What CRL Is Not

CRL does **not**:

* Custody digital assets
* Generate or store private keys
* Facilitate buying, selling, or trading
* Provide financial, legal, or investment advice
* Operate as an exchange, wallet, or protocol

CRL prepares users to participate responsibly — it does not act on their behalf.

---

## Platform Decision

**Phase 1 Platform:** Progressive Web App (PWA)

CRL Phase 1 is built as a mobile-first PWA to ensure:

* Global accessibility
* Fast iteration
* Language flexibility
* Low technical barriers
* Future compatibility with iOS and Android app wrappers

Native mobile apps may be introduced in later phases without rebuilding the core system.

## MVP Scope (Version 1)

### Included

* Modular, self-paced education (“Modules” and “Nodes”)
* Orientation to digital assets and self-custody
* Plain-language explanations and visual guidance

* Guided wallet readiness education (no custody)

### Explicitly Excluded

## Language & Tone Guidelines

CRL avoids hype-driven or speculative language.

The platform does **not** use:

* Urgency framing
* Overused marketing terms
* Fear-based messaging

CRL uses:

* Plain language
* Calm, steady explanations
* “At your pace” guidance
* Clear boundaries and expectations

The goal is trust, clarity, and long-term understanding.

---

## Educational Structure

CRL content is organized as:

* **Modules** — major learning sections
* **Nodes** — small, focused units
* **Memory Builders** — optional review tools

There are no grades, no deadlines, and no pressure to proceed.

---

## Audience

CRL serves:

* Youth and students
* Adults and late adopters
* Military members and families
* Multilingual and underserved communities

People using CRL may later identify as traders, investors, or earners.
CRL’s role is to prepare them safely and responsibly for that participation.

---

## Guiding Principle

If a feature does not help a beginner safely understand and enter crypto **without increasing risk or confusion**, it does not belong in the MVP.

---

## Status

This repository defines CRL’s foundational boundaries.
Implementation details, features, and future phases will build on this structure.
